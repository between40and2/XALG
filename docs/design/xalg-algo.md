# XALG role: Algo

An algorithm is basically around an ADT. For example, Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) is around Graph. So It should be a type generic to the ADT type, and there is a variable for that ADT instance as input.

We made it a class, rather than struct, because I want to use OOP feature, inheritance. For the same problem, such as SSSP, there are multiple ways/solutions to it (such as Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford), that share a basic workflow but stay different in some details.

I do not make an algorithm class inherited from NSObject, because that make  unnecessary dependency to Foundation framework, which is outside of Swift.

An algorithm should not change the state of ADT. Anything generated by the algorithm should be stayed with algorithm, rather than mutating the ADT content that may be irrelevant to other algorithms or ADT itself.

For graph-related algorithm, one of questions to ask/investigate is graph's weighted-ness.

///whether the algorithm works with directed graph or undirected graph, or treated-directed-as-undirected graph. That must be reflected in class generics. See the following code.

```swift
class XALG_Algo_Graph_SSSP<G : XALG_ADT_Graph_Weighted>
```
