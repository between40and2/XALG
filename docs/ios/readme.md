# iOS topics

Here is an off-topic on algorithms. However I like to take this corner of project space to talk about general iOS app development related topics of my experience, in following aspects/areas.

* architecting
* unit testing
* debugging
* performance optimization (prevention and cure)
  * energy
  * UI responsiveness
  * os-friendly

# Unit Testing

# Debugging




prioritize work with GCD/Dispatch
